# FACIAL-GESTURE-BASED-HUMAN-MACHINES-INTERACTION-FOR-PHYSICALLY-DISABLED-PEOPLE

This project was done as part of the final coursework during my B.Tech in Information Technology UnderGraduate Degree. Detailed explanation of the proejct is present in the project report pdf file along with the citations.

## Project Abstract:
  As there is great advancement in the technology in recent years, there has been much improvement in various fields of computing such as Human Computer Interaction (HCI), Computer Vision. Input to the computers has sensed information about physical properties of user, places, or things. 
  For example, computer mouse and keyboard operates by motion imparted by user’s hand. All these techniques may not be suitable to physically disabled people. 
  A way to create an application which replaces the input devices such as  mouse and keyboard  by using face of the user is proposed. 
  This project introduces how head motion of user can be used to control the mouse cursor and how gaze tracking can be used to control the keyboard. A  face detecting system precisely records the motion parameters from video at real-time using a typical webcam.  While the speed decreases when controlling the virtual keyboard and mouse, the system’s performance remains functioning for severely disabled people who have their gaze and head movements as one of their only means of communication.
